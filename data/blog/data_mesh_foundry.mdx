Implementing and Scaling Data Mesh with Palantir Foundry: A Six-Year Retrospective
It’s a pleasure to reflect on the journey of implementing and scaling a Data Mesh using Palantir Foundry over the past six years. My name is Peter, and this story begins in 2018, in the bustling offices of a German national media and tech company. This medium-sized company, responsible for numerous influential news media brands, was about to embark on a transformative data journey.

The Data Chaos of 2018
Back in 2018, the company’s data landscape was a mess. At the heart of the problem was a decentralized data warehouse with over 2,500 tables, little documentation, and wildly inconsistent naming conventions. Data quality was poor, and developer retention averaged just six months. Requests for analytics flooded in from every department, but the data team struggled to manage the volume and complexity.

Our product owner at the time, Günter (let's call him that), was the 15th in just two years. He was tasked with overseeing this decentralized system, which was clearly at its breaking point. Enter Eliza, a bright and enthusiastic data scientist brought in to build a machine learning model aimed at keeping newspaper subscribers engaged. But before she could get started, she hit a wall: accessing the necessary raw data.

Eliza was stuck in a frustrating cycle of waiting for access to the data, which was buried deep in an Oracle cluster. After weeks of delay, she finally received a file — a comma-separated values file — that wasn’t even what she needed. This highlighted the core issue: "time to data" was abysmal. It was taking far too long for anyone to access the data they needed to do their jobs.

The Shift to Palantir Foundry
This is where I entered the story. Tasked with building a scalable data infrastructure, we began implementing Palantir Foundry to improve data accessibility and collaboration across the organization. Foundry's ability to handle structured and unstructured data, offer a user-friendly interface, and integrate various personas (data scientists, engineers, and business users) was a game-changer.

The first priority was reducing the "time to data" — the time it takes for someone new to the organization to access the data they need. Palantir Foundry enabled us to build an environment where any employee could log in through a single sign-on and immediately access the data. Foundry's built-in tools for aggregation, visualization, and data transformation further streamlined the process.

We also put in place three foundational rules:

Only connect known data sources that are essential.
Give everyone reading access to all data (barring any legal or regulatory reasons not to).
No dependencies between teams — if one team needs a dataset, they copy it and build their own pipeline.
This approach allowed us to move fast, innovate, and avoid bottlenecks.

Scaling Challenges: The Data Mesh Evolution
By 2024, the benefits were clear. Every employee had rapid access to all relevant data, and numerous dashboards, reports, and machine learning models were built to drive decision-making. Teams, such as the Justice League (responsible for ad revenue optimization) and the Avengers (tasked with building a recommendation system), were thriving.

However, as teams grew and projects became more interconnected, issues began to arise. One major incident involved the Justice League relying on a dataset created by the Avengers. Without proper communication, the Avengers made changes to their user interest data that unintentionally broke the Justice League’s pricing optimization model. This misalignment had real financial consequences, underscoring the trade-off between independence and coordination.

This brings us to Data Mesh — the methodology that offered a solution to these growing pains. Much like the debate between microservices and monolithic systems, the Data Mesh provided a framework for decentralizing data ownership while maintaining governance and collaboration.

What is Data Mesh?
Data Mesh advocates for:

Decentralized data ownership – Teams own their data products.
Domain-driven design – Data products are built around specific business domains, ensuring relevance and usefulness.
Self-serve data infrastructure – Teams have access to the tools and infrastructure needed to build and maintain their data products.
Federated governance – A global governance model ensures data consistency and compliance across the organization.
With these principles in mind, we introduced data contracts and service level agreements (SLAs) between teams to formalize how data products would be used. The Avengers, for example, now had a contract guaranteeing that changes to their user interest dataset would remain backward-compatible, ensuring the Justice League’s pricing model wouldn’t break again.

The Role of Palantir Foundry in Data Mesh
Foundry’s infrastructure was crucial in supporting the Data Mesh principles. Key features like the data catalog, documentation tools, and lineage tracking provided transparency and accountability. Every dataset in Foundry became discoverable and natively accessible, ensuring teams could trust the data they were consuming.

However, not everything was perfect. While Foundry provided a solid foundation, certain aspects of Data Mesh, such as data contracts by default or enforced communication between teams, still needed to be manually managed. We're continuing to explore ways to automate and enhance these processes within Foundry.

Lessons Learned and Future Directions
As we look to the future, there’s still much to learn and improve. We’re working on integrating Foundry’s open API to better check ownership and automate governance processes. We also plan to experiment with Palantir’s ontology framework to define data contracts more formally.

One key takeaway is that scaling data within an organization requires balancing independence and centralization. A mature Data Mesh approach works best when teams are producing well-defined data products that others can rely on. But if you’re just starting, it’s often easier to stick with a more centralized model until you reach a critical scale where decentralization becomes necessary.

Thank you for joining me on this retrospective. It’s been an incredible six-year journey of growth, experimentation, and learning. I hope our experience with Data Mesh and Palantir Foundry offers valuable insights for those looking to transform their data infrastructure.
