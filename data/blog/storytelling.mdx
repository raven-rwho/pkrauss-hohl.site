# Storytelling

***

This is the second part of my Stanford experience. In this post I tell you a story about the power of good stories and something about how to tell one.

# Storytelling

## Start with a story
Dan started our session with a story about his experience how he learned to take over the famous dancing part in a talent show in a tent camp, many many years ago. 
There was so much emotion and conviction in his storytelling, that we were all sitting there silently and hang on his mouth which is quite interesting if you think 
about the fact that the audience consisted out of seasoned business people coming from around the world. How did
he do it and how did he manage to use every bit and piece of his story in at the end of his session, which caused 
some standing ovation?

## Why are stories such a powerful tool?
Did you know that the emotional part of our brain is taking decisions? The other part is merely reasoning for the decision, means finding good rational arguments that the decision that we took was a good one.
This means our brain is hard-wired to react much stronger than on merely facts, which is a crucial point in our modern society which is flooding us all the time with input data, which we we try to make sense of. In other words 
our brain is filtering all the time and only a fraction of the input that we receive on a daily basis is passing through. Stories are the way how we humans
are passing on our memories since centuries. There is no one who hasnt heared the sentence, "A long time ago, in a kingdom far far away...". Immediatlely we are back in our childhood
and listen to someone that we care a lot telling us something that is changing our world - or at least the perception of it, which is at the end pretty much the same. 

## Practice and get feedback
Everyone can tell a story and has it done before. Maybe you have the perception that you're not good at it, but this is normally just means that you took the decision to not practice. 
With this words, Dan gave us our first task: "Find a partner and tell her a story for one minute how you got your name." This exercise 
brought two surprises for me. Number 1: It is quite hard to to have proper timing and number 2: "hey that is fun!"
Next exercise, new partner of course, you have two minutes to tell any story about a journey that you took but now the listener gives two different kind of feedbacks,
first what was the story literally about and second what was the story **really** about. 
This was quite an eye opener. As trivial as it sounds, but I've never asked someone to give me feedback about the message that they took out of a communocation that I had with them.
Especially in the case of business presentations this is extremely powerful, because it gives you the chance to ensure that the message that you want to deliver, like "we need to change process a", or "we should invest in b", is perceived as intended.
In my case I had the pleasure to listen to a story about a journey to china as a student which was upgraded a a cascading events to a business class trip. It turned out that I complettly misjudged what the message of the story was about. We alsways belive 
that it is completly obvious for our audience what the message behind our stories, presentations and discussions are, but as this little experiment showed - this is **not** the case! Or in other words: "Do you know what the problem with common sense is? It is not so common!"

## Every story is structured the same 
Did you ever realized that every great story out there has the same structure? First let me tell you about it and then give some examples that you most likely know.
1. Platform
2. Tilt
3. Series of cascading events
4. Climax change
5. New reality

### Platform
'Once upon a time, in a kingdom far, far away, there was a princess, who....' Luke Skywalker working on Tatooine, Harry living a miserable life under a staircase at his uncle and aunt, and so many more. All of this is, setting the platform or stage for the story to come.
To get emotionaly attached to a story ideally it is something that the audience can identify with and emotion is what you want to make sure that your audience is listening to you.
### Tilt
Something is happening to the hero which puts everything upside-down - Harry is getting letters deliverer by owls, Luke learns from R2-D2 that princess Lea needs help or Cinderella gets an invite to the ball. 
The same should happen in your story about the next process change or the the necessary invest.
### Series of cascading events
The adventure starts. 
### Climax change
### New reality

## Make your audience a gift

## Practical tips
- The audience has always questions, but no one has the "first" question. Why not bring the first question with you? Open your slide that says "Questions?" wait for a some seconds and if there is silence, continue with: "A question that you might have:"

## Literature
- As we speak
- Do -
